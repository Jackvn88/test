Dear sir/madam 

I had tried to open project with a visual studio express 2013 as advice in this task. I had received a message that project not supported by this version. I had tried use visual studio express 2015. I had a same message. Finally, I end up using visual studio 2017 witch I currently using for my projects. If it is going to be any issues, please contact my recruiter Robin Kirby or me. See my details below.

P.S. I am did not want to over complicate project by using JavaScript for validation, changing  existing code if task not specified to do so or change the Appearance of the client side. I am hoping that you are going to be pleased with my work. Hope to hear from you soon. 

Thank you for your time

Jack
